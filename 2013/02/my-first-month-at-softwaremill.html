	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name">My First Month at SoftwareMill</h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The year 2012 was a year of change to me. First I was moved to a new team in CGM Poland. Things were nice at first, but after a while I lost all my motivation to work. It was time to change the organization and so I applied to a company called <a href="http://www.softwaremill.com">SoftwareMill</a>.
Why them? Trully a coincidence. I was browsing some stuff on LinkedIn and I stumbled upon their job posting and I got intrigued by the fact that they mentioned possibility to work from home. As it turned out, the whole team is distributed! But then I took a closer look at the company and noticed that on SoftwareMill website there&rsquo;s a <a href="http://softwaremill.com/why-softwaremill/our-team">section about developers</a>. Browsing short descriptions of those who worked there I thought that it was a very good company to work at. So I applied in August. It took a longer while to finish the recruitment process (I wasn&rsquo;t accepted at first), but I finally started work at SoftwareMill on 2nd January 2013.</p>

<p>Now a month has passed and I have to say that I&rsquo;m very happy I was given the chance. Not only have I met some brilliant people but it was also a great cultural change for me: from big company, corporation, to a smaller entity with more focus on single developers.</p>

<p>This experience is quite pleasant. Frequent code reviews is something I often missed in my previous jobs but here I have them almost every push to Git repo. That&rsquo;s reassuring, as any mistake I make may be quickly recognized by someone else, but I think I don&rsquo;t have to stress out how important code reviews are :)</p>

<p>The next thing I&rsquo;d like to mention is the Scrum/Chrum meetings. Every team has a Scrum sometime before 10:00. It&rsquo;s your normal Scrum meeting where you answer the three questions. Then is the Chrum meeting. Since the team is distributed, we don&rsquo;t see each other normally, so at 10:00 we have a video meeting where we answer additional, fourth question. This question can be anything &ndash; from what was your yesterday&rsquo;s dinner to how does your surrounding look like at the moment. This is really quite fun meeting and most importantly it&rsquo;s self organizing. There is no specific order at which people speak out but we usually end the meeting around 10:20. When the official meeting is over we are free to discuss about anything.</p>

<p>Working from home was something I always wanted to try and now I have the chance. I was affraid though that some responsibilities might take over my work (like cooking dinner, for example) but fortunately that&rsquo;s not the case. I think I adapted pretty quickly to working from home, <a href="http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2013-02-10/">despite many distractions</a>. There are occasional problems, like having a sick kid at home, but other than that, distractions can be avoided. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that remote work does not equal to working from home, which I hope to prove sometime soon :)</p>

<p>For now I&rsquo;m developing this open source project called <a href="https://github.com/softwaremill/bootstrap">SML Bootstrap</a> and while it&rsquo;s nothing too big, it helps me to familiarize with how things work at SoftwareMill. I also encourage you to check this project out &ndash; it&rsquo;s quite simple, but can be useful if you start your project with Scala and AngularJS.</p>

<p>As a last note I&rsquo;ll just mention that I was given this Macbook Pro to work with ;) While I never agreed with how Apple works, but I have to admit that the quality of build of this machine is just superb.</p>
